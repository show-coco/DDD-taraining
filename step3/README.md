## 3rd Step: FizzBuzz Client
- make a client app with a "FizzBuzz" button
- if you push the button, client sends a request to backend API
- when backend API get a request, it run "Rondomized FizzBuzz" and return the count how many it try to rondomize until get "FizzBuzz"
- client app shows the count got from the API
