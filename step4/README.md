## 4th Step: FizzBuzzJazz
- make a "FizzBuzzJazz" API on backend
	- if the number is multiple of "4", print "Jazz" with of the number
	- if the number is multiple of "3" and "4", print "BuzzJazz" with the number
	- if the number is multiple of "4" and "5", print "BuzzJazz" with the number
	- if the number is multiple of "3" and "4" and "5", print "FizzBuzzJazz" with the number, and exit the process
 	- Keep other "FizzBuzz" features, but don't exit the process on "FizzBuzz" ("FizzBuzzJazz" only)
- make a "FizzBuzzJazz" button on frontend
	- same as "FizzBuzz" button
	- keep "FizzBuzz" button and arrange "FizzBuzzJazz" button side by "FizzBuzz" button
